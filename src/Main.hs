{-

We've now defined all of our handler functions. The last step is
create a dispatch function which will reference all of them. The
mkYesodDispatch function does this, following the standard naming
scheme we've used in our handler modules to get the appropriate
function names.

This function creates an instance of YesodDispatch. That instance is
used by warpEnv to create an application that the Warp webserver is
able to execute.

mkYesodDispatch "App" resourcesApp

main :: IO ()
main = warpEnv App

{-

Note that warpEnv handles a few important details for us:

* Determines which port to listen on based on environment variables.
* Sets up a number of WAI middlewares, such as request logging.
* Converts our Yesod application into a WAI application.
* Runs the whole thing.
